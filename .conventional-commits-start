# Conventional Commits Start Point

This file marks the beginning of conventional commit usage in this project.

- **Start Point**: current commit
- **Setup Date**: 2025-07-16
- **Previous Commits**: 17 legacy commits remain unchanged
- **Future Commits**: All new commits must follow conventional commit format

## Usage

- Use `bumper commit` for interactive commit creation
- Use `bumper suggest "your message"` for commit suggestions
- Use `bumper validate` to check commit format
- Use `bumper preview` to see changelog preview

## Migration Notes

- Legacy commits before this point are preserved as-is
- Changelog generation will include both legacy and conventional commits
- Legacy commits are categorized as 'chore' by default
- Consider gradual migration of legacy commits if desired
